# Linear-Stage-Open-Loop-Control
The purpose of this project was to build an automated system capable of moving carriage to predefined locations along a linear path. The project involved applying the principle 
operations of a stepper motor amd programmatically controlling the linear position and speed of a mass with absolute precision.
